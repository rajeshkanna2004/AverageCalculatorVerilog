# 🧮 Average Calculator using Verilog

This Verilog project calculates the average of four 8-bit numbers and outputs the result as an 8-bit integer.

## 📁 Files
- `average_calculator.v` – Verilog module that computes the average
- `testbench.v` – Testbench to simulate the design
- `waveform.png` *(optional)* – Add a simulation screenshot from Xilinx or ModelSim

## 🧠 Functionality
- Adds 4 unsigned 8-bit inputs
- Calculates the average by dividing the sum by 4
- Output is an 8-bit integer (fractional parts are truncated)

## ✅ Example
If inputs are:
A = 10, B = 20, C = 30, D = 40 → AVG = 25
A = 100, B = 150, C = 200, D = 250 → AVG = 175 


## 🧪 Simulation
Simulate using tools like:
- Xilinx Vivado
- ModelSim
- Icarus Verilog + GTKWave
